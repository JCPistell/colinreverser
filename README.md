Intro
----------

This is a very minimal package for demonstrating R Package development for the CU business analytics program. It is comprised of a single function that reverses a string or number.
You can find the associated series of videos [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLThvbuXxyfhI34y39WFYY__Yay7DZBVxp)

I recommend clone this repo to follow along with the videos!
